# Projects

Welcome to my portfolio,

*Where creativity meets innovation!*

Within these sections, you'll find a diverse showcase of
my projects spanning various domains, each a testament to my passion for technology and software development.

Join me on this journey through a portfolio that encapsulates a spectrum of my technical prowess and showcases
the creativity embedded in each endeavor.




## Qt Framework

Incorporating the Qt into my projects has been a transformative experience, seamlessly merging the robustness
of C++ with the versatility of Python. Leveraging Qt's cross-platform capabilities and rich set of tools, my applications
achieve a harmonious blend of performance, functionality, and user-friendly design.

!!! note ""
    My work in virtual scripting with nodes, a work-in-progress project, holds dual significance as a key
    component of my college final project.

This is a tool editor, where tools are visualized as nodes,
offering a user-friendly interface for effortless customization. 

Noteworthy features include the incorporation of scriptable extensions, powered by Python,
allowing for dynamic and tailored tool enhancements.




## Blender 3D Addons

Within the realm of 3D design and animation, my exploration extends to the development of Blender 3D Addons.
With a keen eye for addressing specific needs in the creative process, these addons introduce new tools, features,
and automation, amplifying the capabilities of Blender for artists and animators



### Custom Tools - Generative Rigs

            <figcaption>Generative Spine Tools in Custom Tools</figcaption>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

This add-on help in creating other tools, those tools automatically available to all
the instances of blender by hiding the complex build/refeshing work itself.

??? note "Tools Created By This Addon"

    List of main tools created:

    - **Reset Constraints -** to fix the retargeting of targets in bone constaints, especially when scaling.
    - **Twist & Tweak -** to generate customizable twists and tweak in any rig.
    - **Add Chain Controls -** powerful tool for hendling bone chains with many options.
    - **Add Spine Pivot -** to generate a [biped spine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wm_WVcbxEM) with swichable pivot.

    and, many more. 



### CUI - Custom UI for Rigs

            <figcaption>Interface Options in CUI Addon</figcaption>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

This is a powerful tool for creating user interface of the rig. this tool lets user to link any path to button
(all widgets in blender have the full path in context menu), even from other editor like geometry nodes and shader editor.



### GLink - Live Link Graphs

<div class="owl-carousel owl-theme">
    <div class="item">
        <div class="inner-item">
            <img src="assets/glink-blender-addon-ui.png" width="700" alt="Graph Link Addon By MohitSainiKnl">
            <figcaption>Graph Link Blender Addon</figcaption>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <div class="inner-item">
            <img src="assets/glink-addon-graph-demo.gif" width="800" alt="Graph Link Addon Demo By MohitSainiKnl">
            <figcaption>Graph Update Demo of GLink Addon</figcaption>

            <figcaption>GLink Addon for Space Switching</figcaption>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

This Addon helps user to automatically update f-curves in blender graph editor, which is helpful in when using *space switching techniques* like - `Aim Space` and `World Space`.

This also include **Glink Manager**, which helps in managing lots of graph-links, example - using this in create walk cycle, linking one side to another.

*Witness the simplicity and power of MS Notepad!*

MSNotepad is a simple text editor, with cross platform support, and a basic text-editing program which enables computer
users to create documents. It is light-weight editor which entirely looks like Microsoft Windows' Notepad.
MSNotepad writes the settings of the application in the Settings.txt file, before closing the application. And load it again at the starting of the application.
